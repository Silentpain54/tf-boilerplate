This directory contains a script to generate visualizations of
training log files (assuming you redirect the outputs of the training
scripts above to a log file). Call as

```bash
$ /path/to/viz.py train.log train.html
```

Load the generated static `train.html` file in your browser. Based on
the visualizer at http://github.com/ayanc/ntviz/
